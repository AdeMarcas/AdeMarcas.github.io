                This was my first ever shortfilm that I made in the second year
                of my MBO education. The theme was "Film Noir". It was very fun
                to make and I learned so much from it. A whole team of seven
                people worked on it but everyone made their own edit of the
                shortfilm. I also had to act in the film which was harder than I
                imagined, but it was a nice added challenge.
