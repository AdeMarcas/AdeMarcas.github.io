                Streetwise Concept
            </h2>
            <p>
                I made this as testing footage for a shortfilm idea I had in
                mind. I wrote the whole script but didn't have enough time to
                film everything, I decided to test some ideas for filming and
                make a concept video. I wanted to try something new and luckily
                a friend of mine had a drone. I visualized something cool and I
                feel like in the end it came out really well.
